## Introduction:
Hey, my name is Charles Okechukwu a fullstack software engineer. I'm in the business of transforming your expectations into industry standard compliant web applications and softwares.

## Projects:
I've built two interesting projects so far:
- FindArtisans:
This project is an amazing one, it helps a user located artisans around the user address who render certain services, the user can access the artisan's contact details, see past reviews and samples of the artisans work, the user also would be able to leave a review of the artisan's service after experiencing the artisan's services.

- HappyPets:
This was a group project i took an active role in, was a petcare app focusing on documenting pet vetinary care, i worked on creating vertinary doctors authentications, managing booked vertinary appointments, updating pet's health records by the vetinary doctor, tracking pet's growth record and displaying a graphical representation of pet's growth data for one year.

## My next project:
I'm, already on works to build an ecommerce/classified web application using the MERN framework, i believe this personal project would help me better understand nodejs and expressjs, as well as working with the react front end framework and working with a mongodb as my previous projects i worked only with MYSQL. Its gonna be exciting!


## Conclusion
Yes i've started my software engineering journey, alot is still needed to be learnt and experience, i'm looking forward to starting my internship and am open to paid internship positions no matter how little the stipend, i just want to learn and grow! Hit me up if you've got any web application development projects or open roles, i wouldn't disappoint you, promise!
